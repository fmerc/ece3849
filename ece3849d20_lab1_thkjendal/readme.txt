To read PWM output into ADC1 input, connect Pin PF_2 to Pin AIN3 (GPIO PE_0).
Time scale, voltage scale, and trigger slope are shown at the top of the LCD. 
CPU load is shown at the bottom. 

Board Functions:
User SW1: [has no effect] change time scale (100, 50, 20, 10, ... , 0.1, 0.05, 0.02 ms)
User SW2: switch between rising/falling edge trigger
Boost Button S1: change voltage scale (0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0 V/div)
